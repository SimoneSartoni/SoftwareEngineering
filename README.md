## About the project:

Adrenaline was one of my 3 bachelor thesis projects.
It was mandatory for "Software Engineering" course attended at Politecnico of Milan, but with my teammates Nicola and Carmelo we decided to go beyond the requirements and we ended with 18k lines of code :sweat_smile:.
It concerned the creation of a digital version of board game "Adrenaline". 
Hope you will find it interesting 	:smile:
Authors: Simone Sartoni, Nicola Rosetti and Carmelo Valore.
